# MCF-Season-1-Source-code
This repository contains the code used for season 1 of my minecraft tournament MCFridays https://mcfridays.xyz/

## Note
* This is just an archived copy of the code and it wont be updated
* This is not the same code used for season 2
* The code will probably require some extra work to get back and running without errors since the last update was not completed due to switching to season 2
* We wont provide the maps, map json files, sql files or any other files used by the event that are not in this repository
* Some parts of this code is messy and a lot of the code is not documented
